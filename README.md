# chesscomgen
Account generator for chess.com, there's a POC for their web API (almost completely done just needs 3 of the requests for the second anti-bot aka kount) but currently accounts are registered with the mobile API. It also includes a method for add friend and report player just for fun, add them if you want.

# Notice
Just for fun, not like this can really be used for "evil" but don't do that. Also make sure to contact #android on slack (User-Agent: Chesscom-Android/4.5.14-googleplay (Android/9; SM-G988N; en_US; contact #android in Slack) their words not mine)
